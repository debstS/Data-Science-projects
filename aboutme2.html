		            <p>Hello Visitor! Debashree Tripathy is a hyper-curious Customer Data analyst with more than 3 years of experience in Data analytics, business intelligence, and now Data Science.</p>
		
		            <p>Along with the professional expertise involving Data analysis, data engineering, data warehouses, OLTP, OLAP, etc., she brings with herself an infectious energy to tell a story though the data, to uncover the real value beneath the shiny labels of 'revenue' and 'profit'. She believes that the essence of why we are doing what we are doing is most important; to find a bigger purpose - the 'Ikigai' behind everything. This has taken her quest to numerous geographies within India across multiple industry domains in her career, starting as a Database Developer with a global automobile firm, to being a Data Analyst on a pharmaceutical project within an Audit Consulting LOB, and now as a Customer Data Scientist within Property Technology, acronymed as 'PropTech'. With that last bit, her journey gets more interesting with the fact that this time, on a quest to find and add more meaning to the job she does, she has now moved continents, did a Master's to upskill, and has now found a newfound love for geospatial data science (and NLP at times!)</p>
		
		            <p>Academically, she holds a Bachelor’s degree from one of the Deemed Universities in India, and a recent Master’s degree in Data Science with Distinction from the esteemed University of Manchester, which is ranked 27th globally. Motivation wise, she hopes to be a part of UN someday, using Data Science for the good of the world, solving one critical problem at a time.</p>
		
		            <p>When not bookmarking stuff and forgetting to ever visit them, she will be found out and about on a foot trail, or binging on a carrot & walnut cake at the local Costa!</p>
