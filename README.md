## A portfolio section bearing information about all my Data Science projects so far.

Below are the broad categories of all the projects that have been/will be covered by me. Each week I will add a new project to any of the below categories depending on the domain. 
Enjoy the read, Explorer :) 


## The World of Geospatial data science 
## A/B Testing projects 
## Time-series forecasting project
## Exploratory Data Analysis projects 
## Power BI projects
## Natural Language Processing projects 
## Large Language Model projects
## Hey there, I am your own Custom Chatbot ! (using Langchain, Huggingface, OpenAI API, Llama 2, etc)
## Research Papers and Case study implementation projects as PoCs (HelloFresh, Trivago)
## Trying out some stuff (journalism Data Science use cases/making portfolio website)



### Project 1: Landscape Genetic Model to study correlation between rise in Malaria cases and Local Habitat practices in light of South Asian lanscape
* A Geospatial data science project undertaking comprehensive land cover investigation to establish linkage between human habitat practices and Malaria propagation
* Imbalanced and unstructured datasets comprising of 150+ columns
* Employed multivariate statistical methods and Exploratory data analysis to analyze environmental patterns and its correlation with spread of Malaria in the region  

  
### Project 2: Customer Churn analysis based on a HelloFresh case study
* This project aims to analyse Customer churn in light of real HelloFresh datasets, and extract some powerful insights
  
### Project 3: Build recommender System for an e-commerce client to analyze shopper and consumer behaviour appeal - Peak workshop
* Built a basic recommender system based on collaborative filtering algorithm in one of Peak's workshops 

### Project 4: Detecting mental health status using WhatsApp chats in Natural Language Processing
* Performed multi-class classification on real-time social media interactions for a population to detect mental health status using Large Language Models and web scraping 

### Project 5: Multivariable Logistic Regression to understand churn prediction for MOOC attrition using social, behavioral and analytical factors
* Explored logistic regression to understand student attrition rates for courses on popular online education platforms such as EdX and Coursera

### Project 6: 'Predict click rate' study based on Trivago Case Study
* The goal of this study is to predict how often a hotel will be clicked based on certain characteristics of the hotel.
* It also aims to provide the right accommodations for users and help advertisers to run well-performing campaigns on the trivago website

### Project 7: Book recommendation system
* The goal of this study is to predict how often a hotel will be clicked based on certain characteristics of the hotel.
* It also aims to provide the right accommodations for users and help advertisers to run well-performing campaigns on the trivago website
