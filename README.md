## A portfolio section bearing information about all my Data Science projects so far.

Below are the broad categories of all the projects that have been/will be covered by me. Each week I will add a new project to any of the below categories depending on the domain. 
Enjoy the read, Explorer :) 


### Project 1: Multivariable Logistic Regression to understand churn prediction for MOOC attrition using social, behavioral and analytical factors
* Explored logistic regression to understand student attrition rates for courses on popular online education platforms such as EdX and Coursera
* [More Details] https://github.com/debstS/Data-Science-projects-portfolio/tree/main/MOOC%20Churn%20Prediction%20Analysis
  
### Project 2: Landscape Genetic Model to study correlation between rise in Malaria cases and Local Habitat practices in light of South Asian lanscape
* A Geospatial data science project undertaking comprehensive land cover investigation to establish linkage between human habitat practices and Malaria propagation
* Imbalanced and unstructured datasets comprising of 150+ columns
* Employed multivariate statistical methods and Exploratory data analysis to analyze environmental patterns and its correlation with spread of Malaria in the region
* [More details] https://github.com/debstS/MalariaProject  

  
### Project 3: Customer Churn analysis based on a HelloFresh case study
* This project aims to analyse Customer churn in light of real HelloFresh datasets, and extract some powerful insights
* [More details] https://github.com/debstS/hellofresh_case_study
  
### Project 4: Book recommendation system
* The goal of this study is to predict how often a hotel will be clicked based on certain characteristics of the hotel.
* It also aims to provide the right accommodations for users and help advertisers to run well-performing campaigns on the trivago website
* [More details] https://github.com/debstS/Book-Recommendation-System-

### Project 5: A/B testing to compare Product website's layout for 3 types of Property Industry stakeholders 
* A comprehensive A/B testing design plan to test the efficacy and outcome of two types of websites layouts, to decide the more preferred and user-friendly layout options.
* [More details] 

### Project 6:Create a Custom Property Chatbot for Question-Answer problem using Langchain and Llama 2 API
* A ChatGPT-like custom Large Language Model 'chatbot' application, trained on custom knowledge base in light of Property Technology customer queries.
* [More details] https://github.com/debstS/Data-Science-projects-portfolio/blob/main/%F0%9F%A6%9C%F0%9F%94%97_Chat_with_PDFs_Custom_Knowledge_ChatGPT_with_LangChain.ipynb 


### Project 7: 'Predict click rate' study based on Trivago Case Study
* The goal of this study is to predict how often a hotel will be clicked based on certain characteristics of the hotel.
* It also aims to provide the right accommodations for users and help advertisers to run well-performing campaigns on the trivago website
* [More details] https://github.com/debstS/trivago_case_study

### Project 8: London Real Estate Analysis using Clustering to find areas with highest venues of interest, to help with making best investment decisions while buying a property
* Built a basic recommender system based on collaborative filtering algorithm in one of Peak's workshops
* [More details] [https://github.com/debstS/team_11](https://github.com/debstS/London-Real-estate-pricing-for-residential-properties/blob/main/README.md)
